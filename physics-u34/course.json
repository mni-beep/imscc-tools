  "description": "VCE Physics Units 3 and 4 guides students from classical mechanics to modern theoretical physics. Unit 3 investigates the relationships between force, energy, and motion, using field models (gravitational, electric, and magnetic) to explain phenomena ranging from satellite orbits to electricity generation and transmission. Unit 4 challenges these classical ideas by exploring the wave-particle duality of light and matter and Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, which redefines time and space at high velocities."
